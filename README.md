The server is hosted on Vercel at https://bookstore-backend-24k44dt0z-warlock911.vercel.app/
The backend is running a Node.js, Express.js and Mongose.js
The Database is a MongoDB Atlas Cluster

Clone the https://github.com/Warlock911/bookstore-frontend.git. 
Run npm install for the dependencies, and npm start, this would bring up the landing page, the server will be connected automatically. 

There might be slight delays on information rendering I think it has something to do with the MongoDb and Vercel interfaces.

The Front end is hosted on Heroku,
The server is hosted on Vercel at https://bookstore-backend-24k44dt0z-warlock911.vercel.app/
The backend is running a Node.js, Express.js and Mongose.js
The Database is a MongoDB Atlas Cluster


Download the bookstore-front end, npm install, npm start, this would bring up the landing page.
I have the node.js files if 
You should be able to interact with it as the server will be online 

There might be slight delays on information rendering I think it has something to do with the MongoDb and Vercel interfaces.
